  "summary": "Diff adds a multi-page React app scaffold with TanStack Router, a sticky navbar + footer, marketing sections (offer banner, membership, testimonials, FAQ), gallery grid and before/after slider, and a booking form wired to a Motoko backend method. Key gap: backend appointment storage is not in stable state, and backend includes unrequested “car wash” service catalog + extra query APIs.",

      "requirement": "Store appointment records in stable state for the canister lifetime and return a confirmation value (appointment id).",
      "reason": "Backend stores appointments in an in-memory Map and nextId var without any stable variables or upgrade hooks shown; this will not persist across upgrades and may not meet the stable-state requirement.",
