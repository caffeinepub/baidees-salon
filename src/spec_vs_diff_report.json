REQ-17 is largely implemented via a new BrandLogo component used in Navbar/Footer and favicon/OG links added to frontend/index.html, but the diff summary does not show the actual image assets being added.",

      "reason": "Code references image paths under /assets/generated, and index.html links to favicon/apple-touch/og images, but the diff summary does not show any image/static asset files being added to the frontend.
