  "summary": "Diff implements a centralized contact config and updates visible phone/tel/WhatsApp usage in Navbar, Home hero CTA, Footer, and (partially shown) Contact/Booking page. Address appears removed from Footer and described as removed from Contact/Booking page, but the diff is truncated and doesn’t provide enough evidence to confirm all site-wide occurrences and acceptance criteria (especially “no remaining old numbers” and “prefilled WhatsApp message preserved”).",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Ensure the WhatsApp booking button/link uses https://wa.me/917735705356 with the existing prefilled message preserved.",
      "reason": "The WhatsApp base URL matches, but the diff introduces a new default message string; without the prior message (or a note that it was preserved), the acceptance criterion about preserving the existing prefilled message can’t be verified from the provided diff summary.",

      "reason": "Some key locations are updated (Navbar, HomePage hero CTA, Footer, Contact/Booking page), but the diff is truncated and does not provide evidence of a repo-wide cleanup/search to guarantee there are no remaining old placeholder numbers or other phone occurrences elsewhere.",

      "reason": "Footer no longer shows an address line, and the Contact/Booking page is described as address-removed, but the Contact/Booking file is truncated and no other pages/components are shown; cannot confirm removal from all other potential UI occurrences (e.g., any map placeholder/caption elsewhere).",
