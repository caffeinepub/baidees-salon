# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a modern, premium, mobile-first multi-page website for “Baidees Salon” with luxury styling and an appointment booking flow backed by a simple stored appointments backend.

**Planned changes:**
- Create 5 routed pages: Home, Services, Gallery, About Us, Contact & Booking, with working navigation across all pages.
- Implement a consistent luxury design system site-wide (black/gold/white palette, elegant serif headings + modern sans body, rounded cards, soft shadows, subtle glassmorphism).
- Add a sticky navbar on all pages with links to all routes and prominent CTAs (Book Appointment, Call Now).
- Build Home sections: hero (tagline “Where Style Meets Confidence”), intro, 5 highlighted service cards, before/after slider (min 2 examples), testimonials (min 3), offer banner, membership/loyalty card section, and CTA buttons.
- Build Services page with categorized service lists (Hair Services, Hair Treatments, Skin & Grooming), each service showing price placeholder, short benefits description, and duration.
- Build Gallery page with responsive grid (min 9 images), an interactive before/after comparison section, and an Instagram-style square-tile layout option.
- Build About Us page with salon story, stylist profiles (min 2), hygiene & premium product assurance, and a “Why choose us” bullet list.
- Build Contact & Booking page with appointment form (name, phone, service, date, time), WhatsApp booking link, maps placeholder section, and opening hours.
- Implement backend canister support to create and store appointment records with required-field validation and confirmation return value.
- Add smooth scroll/section reveal animations and hover/focus effects (with reduced-motion consideration), plus a site-wide footer with social links and contact cues.
- Add required static image assets (hero, gallery, before/after, stylists) under frontend/public/assets/generated and wire them into the UI.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can browse a luxury-styled Baidees Salon website across all pages, view services and gallery content, and submit an appointment booking form that confirms submission; they can also quickly call or book via WhatsApp.
