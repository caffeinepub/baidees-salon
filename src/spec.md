## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site-wide phone number to “+91 77357 05356” and remove any displayed salon address across the website.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace all visible phone number text with exactly “+91 77357 05356” across the Navbar CTAs, Home hero CTA, Contact/Booking page contact card, Footer contact info, and any other occurrences.
- Update all phone-related links to use valid formats: `tel:+917735705356` for click-to-call and `https://wa.me/917735705356` for WhatsApp (preserving any existing prefilled message).
- Remove the salon address UI wherever it appears (e.g., Footer address line, Contact/Booking address section, and any address/map placeholder captions), ensuring the Contact/Booking page layout remains intact.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors see the updated phone number everywhere, can tap to call or open WhatsApp using the correct links, and no longer see any address displayed on the site.
